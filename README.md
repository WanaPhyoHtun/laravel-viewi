* Speed up your development process.
* Turn your components into highly-optimized JavaScript code.
* Build mobile and desktop applications (Planned).

## Launcher ðŸš€

Hey! We've built a Docker-based deployment tool to launch apps and sites fully containerized. You can find all features and the roadmap on our [website](https://uselauncher.com), and we are on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uselauncher) as well!

## Support

We proudly support the community by developing Laravel packages and giving them away for free. Keeping track of issues and pull requests takes time, but we're happy to help! If this package saves you time or if you're relying on it professionally, please consider [supporting the maintenance and development](https://github.com/sponsors/pascalbaljet).

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require protonemedia/laravel-viewi
```

Install the example components and routes:

```bash
php artisan viewi:install
```

Add the `ViewiMiddleware` to the `web` group:

```php
class Kernel extends HttpKernel
{
    protected $middlewareGroups = [
        'web' => [
            \ProtoneMedia\LaravelViewi\Middleware\ViewiMiddleware::class,
            ...
        ],
    ];
}
```

Optionally, you can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="viewi-config"
```

## Usage

Add Viewi components as regular Laravel routes, for example, in `web.php`:

```php
use App\Components\Views\Home\HomePage;
use App\Components\Views\NotFound\NotFoundPage;
use App\Components\Views\Pages\TodoAppPage;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('/', HomePage::class);
Route::get('/todo', TodoAppPage::class);
Route::get('*', NotFoundPage::class);
```

Clear the build and public assets:

```bash
php artisan viewi:clear
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
